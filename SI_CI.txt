Step 1: Start
Step 2: Take the principle amount,interest rate and time from the user  
Step 3: Use for loop for taking one num at a time
Step 4: Read the values from System.out
Step 5: Calculate simple_interest
          SI= principle_amount*interest_rate*time*0.01
Step 6: Calculate compound_interest
          CI= principle_amount*Math.pow(1+interest_rate*0.01,time)-principle_amount
Step 7: print simple_interest and compound_interest
Step 7: Stop
