Step 1: Start
Step 2: Initialize Variable sum=0  
Step 3: Use for loop for taking one num at a time
Step 5: for given num find the number of digits present
             temp=num
            5.1 while(temp>0)
            5.2 diff= temp%10
            5.3 sum=sum + [(diff)*(diff)*(diff)]
            5.4 temp=temp/10
Step 5: Repeat Until num>=0
            5.1 
            5.2 
Step 6: IF sum==temp
            Print "Armstrong Number"
        ELSE 
            Print "Not Armstrong Number"
Step 7: Stop
